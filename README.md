# RNN-LSTM-GRU-on-Sentiments
Implementation of different neural networks on data from stanford and cornell. Classifiying text into two classes, positive and negative sentiments. 

To run the code you need to download pretrained Glove 300 dimension word vectors and then extract the file to a directory named 'glove'
All other directories need to be in the current working directory.

Different hyperparameters are used in RNN, LSTM and GRU neural networks and each model has a plot of validation and training error with number of epochs.

Different parameters that were used:
Hidden units
Learning rate
Sequence Lengths
Glove 300d, 200d, 100d and 50d
